        <section class="text">
            <p>The John Tinker Trail is a ¼ mile long trail in Rich State Forest that was designed to allow anyone to use it regardless of any mobility impairments. The trail meanders through the woods on a smooth and firm surface. It is flat, has benches at both ends, and has two rest areas with benches that provide lovely views of the Nashua River Oxbow along the way. A handicap accessible picnic table at the end provides a comfortable place to rest and enjoy a beautiful view of the Oxbow and the many birds that frequent the area. There is a parking area with handicap (van accessible) parking spots located at the trailhead, which is on the north side of Nod Rd., approximately ½ mile ENE from Rte. 119 where it crosses the Nashua River.</p>

        <section class="text">
            <p>The 12.5-mile NRRT is an asphalt-paved path that goes from Ayer, MA to Hollis, NH and is suitable to be used by people of all abilities. It is mostly shaded and affords beautiful views of ponds, farmland, and the Nashua River along its route. There are parking areas in Groton at Station Ave. and at Sand Hill Rd. that provide reasonably good accessibility but there are currently no designated handicap parking spaces and the surface of the parking area and its connections to the NRRT are not entirely smooth. Accesses in Ayer, Pepperell (Railroad Square), Dunstable (Hollis St. at the NH border) and Hollis (Gilson Rd. at Country Side Dr.) are fully ADA-compliant.</p>
