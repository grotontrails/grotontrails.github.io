    <H2>Hazel Grove Park/Groton Fairgrounds</H2>
    <section class="text"> <p>Not far from Rt 119 Jenkins road is accessed via Mill Street.
It is a long road that dead ends into Hazel Grove Park.  All size rigs can be accommodated
but a yearly ( $50) parking sticker (see website below) is required.  Great access to all the river trails.
Thanks to Fitches bridge West Groton Throne trails and Groton Memorial Town Forest
can be reached from here and also Surrenden Farm area. More than 20 miles of trails if one
knows the area.   The trails to Surrenden Farm are marked and are about a five mile loop.
The race track is private but the inner track is open to the public.  Be prepared  to see sulky's
on the race track and around the barns.</p></section>

    <H2>Groton Memorial Forest/ Town Forest</H2>
    <section class="text"><p>Parking off Rt 225 turn on Wharton Row and follow signs to junction of Town Forest Road,
at stop sign turn onto single lane dirt road.  Room to accommodate three two horse rigs.
Does require backing.  Best to download map for a maze of trails.  Over ten miles of
recreational trails offering tremendous variety of terrain.  Some of prettiest trails along
the river but good conditioning hills toward railroad tracks.</p> </section>

    <H2>J. Harry Rich State Forest</H2>
    <section class="text">Parking on Sand Hill Road/Nod Road near entrance gate.  You can ride loops along the river or loop
out to Nashua River Rail Trail and Shepley Hill.  Best to download maps if not familiar with the area.
Main trail in J. Harry Rich is a wide flat dirt road.  Shepley Hill as name indicates is very hilly
with wide and narrow trails.  Nashua River Rail Trail goes from Ayer to Nashua, NH.  The Groton
section is well maintained but Pepperell rough going.</section>
