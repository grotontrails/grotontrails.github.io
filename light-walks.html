        <section class="text">
            <p> The John Tinker Accessible Trail is a stunning wheelchair accessible route through the woods. The trail begins with an off street parking lot that leads to a smooth gravel pathway. This wide pathway follows the Nashua River, so any trail users may observe the wildlife in and out of the river. Along the trail are scenic overlooks that exhibit inviting stone benches. This trail is family friendly and ends where Groton's first trading post was built by John Tinker himself. </p>

        <section class="text">
            <p>The Groton Place is a well loved property that follows the Nashua River. With many intertwined loops these trails are optimal for everyone, whether you are an experienced hiker or just looking for a relaxing stroll. This property has stunning features scattered throughout its network of trails. There is a charming bridge that leads straight to the beginning of the trails. There is a path that traverses a field edged by the forest. If that is not what you want there is a trail that is surrounded entirely by rhododendrons, which caught at the right time are in full bloom. As you navigate the trails you can take a rest on a scenic round bench that doubles as a monument or you can watch the wildlife. The pine needle blanketed trails are radiant so bring your family, friends, and pets to enjoy this network of trails together.</p>
            <p> It is suggested to take Sabine River Trail and Rhododendron Trail.</p>
