    <section class="post"><H2>Groton Place</H2>
       <section class="text">
            <p> The Groton Place is a beautiful well loved property that follows along the Nashua River. With lots of intertwined loops these trails are optimal for everyone, whether you are an experienced hiker or just beginning. This property has many stunning features that appeal to all. There is a charming bridge, a boat house, and a twisting river. By the Nashua River there is a scenic round bench that doubles as a dog monument, watching the wildlife going in and out of the river from this point is truly amazing. The wildlife of the Nashua River is numerous and fascinating to watch. The pine needle blanketed trails are radiant as well as wide so bring your family, friends, and pets. </p>

        <section class="text">
            <p>J. Harry Rich State Forest is a well worn path through the woods that follows the Nashua River. While walking this path bird song floats through the air and flies to the walkerâ€™s ears. The river quietly drifts along with the trail as wildlife slips in and out. Taking a walk in this state forest is peaceful and enlightening. </p>

        <section class="text">
            <p>This is a beautiful riverside property that includes wide dirt trails through the forest and a well loved swimming hole. This swimming hole has a patch of sand and a rope swing. For those less swimming inclined less than 20ft away is the river part that is much shallower. Bring your family, friends, and pets to enjoy this charming swimming spot.</p>
