<section class="post"><H2>Gamlin Crystal Springs Esker Walk</H2>
    <section class="text">    
        <p>The Gamlin Esker Trail traverses a long, high esker, which is a steep-sided ridgeline left by the melting glacier. The hike begins with an ambitious climb up the side of the esker. Once atop, the hike becomes a leisurely trek along the wooded spine of the esker. Hikers traversing the esker ridgeline are afforded fine views of Cow Pond Brook flowing below, another remnant of glacial times. Deer are seen on the Gamlin Esker Trail, and the esker is habitat for nesting turtles and playful otters. Later in the hike, the Gamlin Esker Trail features a prominent wetland area, with constant beaver activity.</p>
