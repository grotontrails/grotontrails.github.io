    <P>These pages are owned and maintained by the Friends of the Groton Trails Network. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly trail system that 
	encourages residents to enjoy the open spaces and conservation land in Groton. We encourage people to see a different perspective of Groton 
	by exploring our trails and parts of town never seen from the roadways. We promote the trails 
	by setting up and staffing booths during <a href="http://www.grotonfest.com/">Grotonfest</a>, 
	organizing hikes, and supporting the annual <a href="http://www.grotontftr.freeservers.com/">Groton Town Forest Trail Races</a>. </P>

    <p>We promote and support the work of the <a href="http://www.townofgroton.org/Town/BoardsCommittees/TrailsCommittee.aspx">Groton Trails Committee</a>, 
	which is responsible for developing new trails and maintaining the existing trails network in Groton. 
	Together we evaluate trail routes, consider safety issues, address parking and access, mark new trails, and 
	revise the trail map to reflect additions and changes. We also organize hikes and work parties and are 
	always looking for participants. </p>
	
	<p>The code for the website is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/grotontrails/grotontrails.github.io">GitHub</a>. The online maps 
	are powered by <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>, <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>,
	and  <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/42.6262/-71.5903">OpenStreetMap</a>. 
	Our trail data is maintained in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/42.6262/-71.5903">OpenStreetMap</a> and can 
	be downloaded from <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/">overpass turbo</a>.

    <H2>Eagle Scouts</H2>
        <p>Hello future Eagle Scouts! If you want to do a project for the Trail Committee please read through this, then if you are ready, contact us through email to set up a meeting. When you come to a meeting please show up with rough plans and a marked up map</p>
        <p>Here are some things to consider before coming to a meeting. What are your materials? How are you getting the materials? Where are you putting your project? Who is the land owner? Do you have their approval? How are you going to transport your materials/project in? Do you need an RDA (WPA/request for determination of applicability form)? Please follow the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/service/approvals/wpa-form-1.html">RDA Form</a> instructions carefully. Note that RDA's take at least 3 months to be processed. Please consider if you are building a bridge, what is your foundation? Is it usable by horse or bike? How close is it to wetlands? </p>
