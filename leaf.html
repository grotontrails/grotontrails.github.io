	<H2>Scarlet Hill</H2>
	<section class="text">
		<p> The Scarlet Hill walk starts out in a gorgeous field with views of grazing horses and horseback riders. The field opens
			up into rolling, green hillsides with a speckling of trees and many gorgeous wildflowers poking out of the uncut grass.
			There is a quick but steep path up the hill that leads to an amazing overlook. This eastward overlook has a view of the
			MIT Haystack Observatory and miles of only trees. The view of trees framed by the faint outline of blue mountains and
			in front of it a picturesque view of stables. </p>

	<H2>Chestnut Hill</H2>
	<section class="text">
		<p> Chestnut Hill is a truly stunning southeast overlook onto the expansive forests of the area. There are two ways up to the
			top of this tall hill, there is a dirt road or a series of switchbacks through the wooded hillside. This is perfect for
			those who love the adventure of hiking new trails or those who get frustrated with dead ends. At the top of Chestnut Hill
			is a water tower and a flat grassy area around it. This is the perfect place stop, have a picnic, and gaze at the wonderful
			views that Chestnut Hill provides. Chestnut Hill would be the perfect place to watch the sunrise from. Chestnut Hill is
			the longest walk out of the three listed, but it is very rewarding. </p>

	<H2>Gibbet Hill</H2>
	<section class="text">
		<p>The Gibbet Hill walk is short, but steep. The walk up the hill takes less than 10 minutes with wonderful views at the top
			past the castle. </p>
		<p>There is limited on street parking. Please consider other locations for your fall walk during peak weekends in November.</p>
		<p> This walk is an enchanting walk up to a castle of stone and views that stretch for miles. After a quick climb up the hill
			an old burned down castle emerges. The castle is framed by seemingly ancient trees and a grassy hilltop. The castle is
			a wonderful place to have a picnic and watch the sunset. Not only is the castle a great place to have a picnic the castle
			has a pok√©stop! This is a great place to have a picnic because it has places to sit and shade. Shortly after the castle
			is a captivating westward view. The view looks across the lush green fields that fade into a forest of green in the spring
			and a fiery array in the fall. This view captivates the onlooker as alluring houses that seem painted on peek through
			the trees. While standing at this lookout the walker can watch the wind make the lush forest come alive and dance in a
			enthralling tapestry of colors. The truly picturesque lookout point on top of Gibbet Hill can truly be appreciated by
			all. : ) But seriously it is nice. </p>
