    <H2>Scarlet Hill</H2>
    <section class="text">
        <p>The Scarlet Hill walk starts out in a gorgeous field with views of grazing horses. The field opens up into 
        rolling hillsides with a speckling of trees. Take your time and examine the uncut grass to observe 
        the many gorgeous wildflowers. There is a quick but steep path up Scarlet Hill that leads to an amazing overlook. 
        This Eastward overlook has a view of the MIT Haystack Observatory and miles of trees. The view of trees 
        framed by the faint outline of blue mountains coupled with a picturesque view of the stables, makes for a gorgeous walk. 
        </p>
        <p>The Scarlet Hill is a quick 10 minute hike. Park at the end of Shattuck Street and wear 
        boots because some parts of the trail may be wet.

	<H2>Gibbet Hill</H2>
	<section class="text">
		<p>The Gibbet Hill walk is short, but steep. The walk up the hill takes less than 10 minutes and it has wonderful views at the top past the castle. </p>
        <p>This is an enchanting walk up to a castle of stone and views that stretch for miles. After a quick climb up the hill an old 
            burned down castle emerges. The castle is framed by seemingly ancient trees and a grassy hilltop. The castle is a wonderful 
            place to have a picnic and watch the sunset because there are places to sit and lots of shade. Shortly after the 
            castle is a captivating westward view. The view looks across the lush green fields that fade into a forest of 
            green in the spring and a fiery arramy in the fall. This view captivates the onlooker as houses, that seem to be 
            painted on, peek through the trees. The truly picturesque lookout point on top of Gibbet Hill can truly be appreciated by all. </p>
        <p>There is very limited street parking. Please consider other locations during peak weekends in November or if visiting 
            before 4:00 pm, park at the back of the Gibbet Hill Restaurant parking lot.</p>
