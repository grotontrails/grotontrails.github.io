        <P>The Groton Town Forest is one of the largest trail networks in Groton. This network of trails is truly very diverse and will suit anyoneâ€™s wishes. The twisting trails and intertwined loops will provide a challenge to even the most experienced hiker. Whether you want to go for a stroll on a welcoming summer day or tear it up on a mountain bike this property is for you. There is a scenic route that follows the Nashua River as well as an alluring trail that follows the old railroad tracks. A walk in the Groton Town Forest is truly wonderful as you let your worries and obligations fade away and just enjoy the untouched beauty of nature. </P>
        <P>Not only do we recommend that you get lost here on foot and bike, but feel free to bring a buddy to get lost with. Whether that buddy be a person, dog, horse, or all of the above, we do not judge.</P>
