	<H2>Groton Town Forest</H2>
	<section class="text">
		<p>The Groton Town Forest has smooth flowing trails that are suitable for all abilities. 
        Whether it is a network of cart roads or the 8 miles of single track, all routes lead to 
        big smiles. For those looking for a longer route head north to Fitch's Bridge, cross over 
        and head south to return. Parking is at the end of Town Forest Road.</p>

	<H2>Wharton Plantation</H2>
	<section class="text">
		<p>Wharton Plantation has some of the more challenging trails in Groton, Wharton's 5-6 
        miles of rocky terrain will test even the most accomplished riders. If you are up for more, 
        extend the ride by venturing over to Crystal Spring. Park at the junction of Martin Pond 
        Road and Rocky Hill Road.</p>

	<H2>Williams Barn</H2>
	<section class="text">
		<p>Williams Barn has a well marked network of trails for all abilities. If Williams Barn is 
        too short, venture across Chicopee Row to Fitch Woods and McLain's Woods. This makes for 5-6 
        miles of mostly single track trail. Chestnut Hill is a challenging climb that rewards with loop back down the hill. Parking at Williams Barn off of Chicopee Row.</p>
