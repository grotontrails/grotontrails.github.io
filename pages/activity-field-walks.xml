	<H2>Still Meadow</H2>
	<section class="text">
		<p>This parcel’s name is a play on words, because there was a prohibition era still on the property (and parts of it can “still” be found). The meadow, or actually two fields connected by a very short farm road, is home to many pretty wildflowers, birds, and deer. There is a small parking area across from 292/296 Nashua Rd. Go through the opening in the wooden fence and park on the left. If you want to venture beyond the fields, you can take the trail at the southern end of the first field to the Northwoods Pond or the trail at the southern end of the back field to Wattles Pond, a kettle pond created by a hunk of the glacier that broke off as the mile-high glacier over Groton was receding 10,000 years ago.</p>

	<H2>General Field and Surrenden Farm</H2>
	<section class="text">
		<p>The land slopes down gently from a nice wildflower-decorated park-like area next to the parking and gives you a panoramic view to the south and southwest. You can stay up on the hill to soak in the views of many towns in the area as well as the stand-out Mt. Wachusetts, or you can take a trail that goes about 2 miles around the field and connects with Surrenden Farm field to the west. These two fields provide spectacular sunset views when the weather cooperates. The General Field is on the border between Groton and Ayer. Access is from Farmers Row (Rte. 111). Take a paved road that is about 0.1 miles south of Joy Ln. to the parking area. </p>
