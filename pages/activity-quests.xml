    <p>Questing, or what the British call letter-boxing, has arrived in Groton.</p>
    <p>With more than 100 trails, walking is a terrific way to enjoy the town and countryside of Groton.  This
     questing program will encourage people of all ages to explore Groton’s town center, hills, and 
     forests as well as appreciate its history and beauty.</p>

    <p>Questing is basically a treasure hunt where clues are used to navigate a walk that ends with a
     “letterbox” (variously, a bird house, plastic box, or a ziplock bag in a tree cavity) in which 
     the successful navigator finds a stamp and stamp pad with which to mark the accomplishment in 
     their questing notebook.  A stamp is a small reward (although kids love it), but the real amusement 
     lies in following the clues, finding the way, and seeing your community in a new perspective.</p>
    <p> Most quests are highly site-specific with a wide variety of themes.  Several highlight 
    aspects of the natural world or the history of the community.  Some are integrated into 
    local school curricula.</p>
    <p>Download the quest of your choice from the town web site and you are ready to quest.</p>
    <p>Happy Questing!</p>
