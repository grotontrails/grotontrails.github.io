        <p>These are great places to view field birds like bob o links and redwing blackbirds, with Mt. Monadnock in the background.</p> 
        <p> Parking is easiest off Farmers Row (Rt 110) heading to Ayer. It is the first right after Joy Lane. 
         Proceed straight to large paved area. There are two large fields bordered by woods. These are great places 
         to view field birds like bob o links and redwing blackbirds with Mt. Monadnock framing the view. One can 
         loop one or both fields using Shirley Road.</p>
