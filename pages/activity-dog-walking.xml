        <p>I recognize this bridge, over the water lilies and dragonflies, I am so excited, tail wagging and nose twitching.
            Who will I meet today? Freedom is bounding through the wildflower meadow, grass twitching at my fur. I must
            sniff the stone, dog statue, it’s so real it makes me check again. Under the shady trees I splash into the
            cool clear river, oh please throw my stick <em>one more time</em>. Onwards my paws race, through the Rhododendron’s,
            chasing those delicious smells, onward I run - free.</p>
